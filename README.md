# XMLtoPDF
This project intends to create a feature to be added to the core platform that will allow users to set up document templates to be used alongside transactional data representing Confirms, Invoices, Price Fixing, Bill of Lading and other document types and create a well-formed pdf document to be saved locally on the computer.
